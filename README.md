Got it! Here is the updated README file with the correct command to start the Rails server:

# Shop Project

This is a Rails project for an online shop application.

## Project Setup

1. Make sure you have Ruby and Rails installed on your system. This project requires Ruby version X.X.X and Rails version X.X.X.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shop.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd shop
   ```

3. use 3.1.2
   ```
   rvm use 3.1.2
   ```

4. Install the required gems:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

5. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rails db:setup
   ```

6. (Optional) If you want to populate the database with sample data, run the seed file:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rails db:seed
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the Rails server and run the application, use the following command:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rails server
   ```

or simply:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rails s
   ```

This will start the server on `localhost` (127.0.0.1) and run on port 3000 by default.

You can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

If you want to run the server on a different port or IP address, you can specify them using command-line options. For example:

   ```bash
   bundle exec rails server -p 4000 -b 0.0.0.0
   ```

This will start the server on port 4000 and bind it to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0), making it accessible from other devices on the same network.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Rails directory structure:

- `app/`: Contains the main application code, including models, controllers, views, and helpers.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the Rails application.
- `db/`: Contains database-related files, including migrations and seeds.
- `public/`: Contains static files that are served directly by the web server.
- `vendor/`: Contains third-party libraries or plugins.
- `Gemfile`: Specifies the gem dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and setup instructions.

- Ruby version X.X.X
